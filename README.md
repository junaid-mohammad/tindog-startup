# Tindog

This repository contains the source code for **Tindog**, a playful website inspired by dating platforms, but designed for dogs! Tindog showcases an example layout for a fictitious site where users can "find love" for their pups, combining humor with practical web development techniques.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to learn to create a visually engaging, fun website mockup using Bootstrap, showcasing practical web design skills with an emphasis on responsive layouts and thematic styling. By building Tindog, I practiced structuring content creatively while focusing on aesthetics and functionality.

## Features

- **Hero Section**: A vibrant introduction with a catchy tagline to engage visitors.
- **About Section**: An overview that explains the concept behind Tindog.
- **Featured Profiles**: Playful profiles of "available" dogs, complete with images, names, and personalities.
- **Plans and Pricing**: An illustrative pricing section for hypothetical subscription options.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Gradient Background**: Learned how to use multiple colors and transition between them to add some super lightweight styling to my background.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Built the structural content and layout of the website.
- **CSS**: Styled each section for a modern, cohesive design that aligns with the theme of a pet-focused dating site.
- **Bootstrap**: Used extensively throughout the website for nav bar, hero, cards and carousel.
- **Media Queries**: Implemented for adaptable design across various screen sizes.

## What I Learned

- Enhanced skills in creating themed, visually appealing web layouts with HTML and CSS.
- Gained hands-on experience with using Bootstrap and incorporating pre-made and pre-styled CSS into my website.
- Improved responsive design techniques to ensure usability on multiple devices.
- Learned how to balance playful content with structured, professional layout practices.
